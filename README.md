# Commoditisation and Programming Languages

Presentation I ([@berenguel](https://twitter.com/berenguel)) gave at [Wardley Maps BarCamp 2020](https://www.map-camp.com/_pages/2020-07-29_Germany/).

I recommend you check the version with [presenter
notes](https://github.com/rberenguel/commoditisation-languages/raw/master/commoditisation-with-notes.pdf)
which is only available here.

Once the video is available I will add a link and hopefully all the great questions and comments from the audience as an additional slide at the end.

This presentation is formatted in Markdown and prepared to be used with
[Deckset](https://www.decksetapp.com/). The drawings were done on an iPad Mini 5
using [Procreate](https://procreate.art). **Here only the final PDF and the
source Markdown are available**. Sadly the animated gifs are just static images
in the PDF.
