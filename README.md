# Commoditisation and Programming Languages

Presentation I ([@berenguel](https://twitter.com/berenguel)) gave at [Wardley Maps BarCamp 2020](https://www.map-camp.com/_pages/2020-07-29_Germany/).

I recommend you check the version with [presenter
notes](https://github.com/rberenguel/commoditisation-languages/raw/master/commoditisation-with-notes.pdf)
which is only available here.

A recording is available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4tnJCtpzow). I
will add a slide with the questions and insights from attendees as soon as
possible.

This presentation is formatted in Markdown and prepared to be used with
[Deckset](https://www.decksetapp.com/). The drawings were done on an iPad Mini 5
using [Procreate](https://procreate.art). **Here only the final PDF and the
source Markdown are available**. Sadly the animated gifs are just static images
in the PDF.

You can find a conversion from Deckset to Reveal.js using [Haskset](https://github.com/rberenguel/haskset) (this was the guinea pig)
[here](https://rberenguel.github.io/commoditisation-languages/commoditisation.html#/)
